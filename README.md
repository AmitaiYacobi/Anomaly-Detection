# Anomaly-Detection

This project is a flight anomalies detector that works in two steps:
In the first step it learns data of a normal flight (the filght is represented as a csv file)
and then, by using algorithms like Linear Regression or Minimum
Enclosing Circle, it is able to detect anomalies of a new flight.
The project is coded in C++ and also uses OOP principles.
