# Anomaly-Detection

This project is a flight anomalies detector that works in two steps: <br />
In the first step it learns data of a normal flight (the filght is represented as a csv file) <br />
and then, by using algorithms like Linear Regression or Minimum
Enclosing Circle, it is able to detect anomalies of a new flight. <br />
This project is actually a basis for other projects and applications that will use the detection algorithms that are implemeted here. <br />
The project is coded in C++ and also uses OOP principles.
