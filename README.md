# Anomaly-Detection

This project is a flight anomalies detector that works in two steps: <br />
First it needs to learn data of a normal flight (flight is represented as a CVS file) <br /> 
and then, by using algorithms like Linear Regression or Minimum Enclosing Circle, it is able to detect anomalies of a new flight. <br />
This project is actually a basis for other projects and applications that will use the algorithms that are implemented here. <br />
The project is coded in C++ and also uses OOP principles.
